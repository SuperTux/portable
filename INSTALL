SuperTux Portable Installation
==============================

To compile SuperTux you need a copy of DevKitPro and libgba, which are
both available at:

 * http://www.devkitpro.org/

After you have unzipped it both, just set the environment variable
DEVKITPRO to the directory where you unzipped it and run:

 % make

In the top level dir of SuperTux Portable. Currently some of the .raw
files are not generated automatically, so some manual work with
'png2raw' is needed to get a clean compile.
